# Game Development Plan: Simplified TFT-like Game in Pygame

## High-Level Plan:

### 1. Setup the Environment
- Install Python and Pygame.
- Create a basic window with 1920x1080 resolution.

### 2. Define Game Elements
- Grid Player Boards
- Units and their properties
- Shop system
- Player information display

### 3. Implement Game Mechanics
- Unit placement and grid interaction
- Drag and drop for the shop
- Turn-based mechanics with round progression
- Unit combat and movement logic

### 4. User Interface
- Design and implement the UI for the grid, shop, player info, and middle part.
- Implement 'Ready' buttons and round progression.

### 5. Game Logic
- Health and damage system
- Gold earning and spending
- Win/Loss conditions and tracking

### 6. Testing
- Test each component individually.
- Playtest the game to ensure mechanics work as intended.

### 7. Refinement
- Debug and fix any issues.
- Refine user controls and interactions.
- Add final touches like sounds, animations, etc.

## Implementation Steps:

### 1. Setup
- Make sure Python and Pygame are installed.

### 2. Window Initialization
- Create a Pygame window with the specified resolution.

### 3. Game Element Classes
- Create classes for the board, units, shop, and player info.

### 4. Game Mechanics
- Implement the grid logic for placing units and moving them.
- Create a shop that randomly generates units to buy.
- Implement the drag-and-drop functionality for the shop.

### 5. UI Design
- Draw the grid, shop, player info, and middle part on the screen.
- Implement the 'Ready' button logic to start the round.

### 6. Game Logic
- Create a health and gold system for the players.
- Implement the round system, with the number of units increasing every two rounds.

### 7. Testing and Refinement
- Test each part of the game for functionality and user experience.
- Refine based on feedback and observed issues.

### 8. Final Touches
- Add any additional features like sound effects, music, and animations.
